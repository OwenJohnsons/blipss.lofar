[FFA_parameters]
min_period = 30 ; Minimum trial folding period (s) for FFA search (d: 10.0), 30 here as the sample time on the LOFAR stations is 2.7 seconds -> (2.7 x 10) ~ 300
max_period = 300.0 ; Maximum trial folding period (s) for FFA search (d: 100.0), 10 samples within this time frame.
fpmin = 3 ; Minimum number of signal periods that must fit in the data. In other words, place a cap on period_max equal to DATA_LENGTH / fpmin. (d: 3)
SNR_threshold = 6 ; Threshold S/N for peak detection in periodogram via matched filtering (d: 8.0)
bins_min = 10 ; Minimum no. of bins across folded profile. Minimum period/bins_min sets the duty cycle resolution of the FFA search. (d: 10)
bins_max = 11 ; Maximum no. of bins across folded profile. Typically, set to 10 percent larger than bins_min to maintain roughly uniform duty cycle resolution across periods. (d: 11)
ducy_max = 0.5 ; Max duty cycle of search (d: 0.5)
do_deredden = True ; Do you want to deredden the time series before searching? (True/False) (d: False)
